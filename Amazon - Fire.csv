"1","5","Sarah M.","5 reviews","    I got my son this tablet for bringing his math grade up 19 points in 1 marking period. Not only did I get it on sale for $40 (usually they are $50 but black Friday they were $35), it was really easy to set up. You can have multiple ""accounts"" on there (2 adults and I think 2 kids) so they each require a password to log in. He ended up dropping it face down on our tiled kitchen floor, cracking the screen. I chatted with Amazon's customer service (based in India, so I used the chat option online) and they ended up sending me a replacement kindle, 2 day shipping! No where offers a user error warranty and now we don't have to deal with the cracked screen. I cant see spending hundreds of dollars on an Ipad, when you can get this tablet for $50 and end up with superior customer service!!!   "
"2","5","Amy P.","19 reviews","    I love it! It is user friendly and has all the features that you could want in a table. Amazon has amazing customer service and I am also a Prime member. I like to read, but I don't like to carry cumbersome books around. I can find almost anything I want to read on my kindle and download it for an affordable price. It fits perfect in my purse so I can use it anywhere to kill time. I love the wifi and browsing features as well. The 7"" screen is worth the small amount extra. I highly recommend the Kindle to anyone in the market for a tablet.    "
"3","5","Whitney H.","16 reviews","    The Fire HD is fantastic. I purchased 2, one for each of my kids and they love it. They are too young to own a phone so instead of stealing my phone and using all my space to download their games, they can now have their own. I love that it has parental blocks so they can't purchase anything without my password and I can block the internet and email if needed. Since it's a Kindle, we have access to books as well so when it's time for them to do their reading, they don't need to do anything else, they just download a book.    "
"4","2","Jessica R.","187 reviews","    The battery life on this is terrible. Amazons customer service is terrible. Their solution is to buy another kindle. Why would I invest more money in a product that only lasted 8 months and they had no interest in helping fix the one I had or replace it. They just want your money and then they'll place you on hold and transfer you to 3647499 people making you rehash your story and problem 64738292 times before telling you sorry can't help, but you can buy another one! Awful!    "
"5","4","Emily D.","10 reviews","    Awesome little tablet; however, I do wish that there were more available apps and more reliable apps for android tablets. The tablet itself is good for the most part, but the apps crash quite often. I like the battery life of the tablet so far and its usability. There are some things (like downloads) I can't quite seem to find on it, but hopefully I will learn the tricks of the trade soon! I even found it an adorable little case!    "
"6","1","Channon M.","19 reviews","    I purchased not only one of these tablets, but two of them, just to be continually disappointed. In the first two months of usage, no problems at all. The interface was a little clunky but i got used to it. Then after adding music to my library, the device would crash ALL THE TIME. Even once restored and restored, i would continually have the same issue. I have since purchased an iPad mini and am so much happier because of it.    "
"7","5","Shelley D.","14 reviews","    What a simple and lightning fast little tablet! I love that it perfectly syncs to my Amazon account. It is a very affordable choice, and I can read my kindle books, watch Amazon videos (even download them to watch later, which is very helpful when travelling. It is also good for other functions, such as games, apps, and simple internet browsing. The battery life is good, and I use it all the time.    "
"8","1","Loni R.","142 reviews","    I absolutely hated this tablet, it runs out of storage which you can not upgrade you have to pay to do pretty much anything on it and god forbid you have added money to an Amazon account and forgot your password. If so you are out that money. I will never own another, and will always from here on out use full Android devices only, functionality was poop Here is what I thought of mine.   "
"9","4","Misty Y.","61 reviews","    LOVE my tablet, and my kids do too! Love that I can put it on FreeTime for my kids and know that they will be limited on what and how long they can play! Super easy to use. Only issue to this point has been that the kids tend to quickly use up all the memory and I frequently have to delete things just so that it can connect to wifi. Definitely need to look into expanding storage!   "
"10","5","claudia w.","8 reviews","    At the begining i didn't like the way it run, it wasn't as costumer friendly as an ipad, but i got used to it within a couple of hours and then i loved it! I use it all the time, i read on it, i stream movies and TV shows, i play games and check my social media... its hd and so much easier than go and find my TV remote, everything can b done in seconds... LOVE IT   "
"11","5","Jill S.","67 reviews","    This is my go to device when shopping online, watching movies, checking Facebook and basically everything else except creating documents with word. It is great to be able to set up profiles for each family member. My kids only see and can only access what I want them to. Now that the Kindle Fires accept SD cards it has bumped up to a 5 star product.    "
"12","5","Collette R.","15 reviews","    I use this everyday. I have had it now for two year San Diego have dropped it many times and has not got a scratch on it. I find this very handy to have and I keep everything on itm although you have to take into consideration the apps you pay for on Amazon store are often free on Google app store but other than that would recommend to anyone.   "
"13","4","Jennifer B.","107 reviews","    The Amzon Fire tablet is nice fore the price. It has some things I don't love about it and other things I do enjoy. I pretty much use the table for reading or letting my kids play video games. It takes a while to load certain games and videos. If you're mostly looking for an ereader of sorts this is a great option and not too pricey.    "
"14","4","Lisa C.","20 reviews","    I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It does a good job of staying connected to the Internet. It has a child mode so they won't buy a bunch of games or apps. It also allows you to have multiple profiles on one tablet which is really cool. The camera is not the best but for a kid who just wants to use the camera it's okay.   "
"15","4","Jacqueline M.","18 reviews","    I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. He had an iPad which he loved but dropped it and shattered the screen beyond repair. This tablet was a very inexpensive but decent replacement. It work well enough for what he uses it for which is watching YouTube or Amazon Prime tv. I would say it's pretty good for the price I paid.    "
"16","4","Andrea Q.","6 reviews","    Great tablet for our 3 year old daughter. We wanted something relatively inexpensive with parental controls, and this product has it. We paired it with a durable protective case and has been going strong for one year now. We chose this option over the kids version for the price and the availability of us using it as well.    "
"17","5","Donna B.","6 reviews","    I have the 7HD and I also have an Amazon Paperwhite. Both of these products are great. I can do everything on the HD7 that I want in this size ""computer""  Love it. So glad I decided to go ahead and get one. Have not had any issues with it at all. I play lots of games on it and the battery stays charged for several days.   "
"18","5","Angela E.","8 reviews","    I had to purchase a new kindle because my daughter took over my precious one. I absolutely love this tablet! It does everything that I need and then some! Super affordable and easy to use! My daughter now tries to steal this one :) I never thought I would read a digital book, but I don't mind doing that one this one!   "
"19","5","Kaylene S.","8 reviews","    Coming from a iPad, this took a little getting used to, but I love that this is much more durable, that it fits in most of my purses, and that I read more than game now!! I wish I allowed instagram, but I can't seem to find the right app. This tablet has been so nice to have, it was a birthday gift from my husband.   "
"20","4","Jori J.","53 reviews","    We are an amazon.com family through and through! I'm on my 3rd kindle, my husband is on his 3rd and our daughter is on her second. My only complaint is that you can only purchase apps through amazon - not the google play store and that can cause some frustration with my daughter who likes to play specific games   "
"21","5","Catherine C.","18 reviews","    For the price I did not think this would be that great. I took the chance and ordered one for my 8 yr old at Christmas. After seeing and using hers I ordered one for me too. Easy to use, lightweight and every bit as good in every way as the more expensive brands, way to go Amazon. Great product, great price.   "
"22","4","Emily M.","22 reviews","    I bought this tablet for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He uses it when he travels for work so he watches Netflix and plays games on it. He says he loves it and the only thing he said is sometimes when purchasing apps from the store it freezes up a bit but other than that it works great for him.   "
"23","4","Cerra C.","24 reviews","    I love my Kindle Fire. I had previously used a Kindle app on another device but the Fire is so much easier because I am able to purchase books directly from bookstore without needing to exit the Kindle app/bookstore. My eyes don't get tired reading on this device when compared to my phone or other tablets.   "
"24","5","Alicia J.","7 reviews","    I love my Kindle Fire. I use it mostly for reading and Facebook. I have only had it lock up once and had to restart it. it was a wonderful price as I got it on sale. It is very easy to use and I love that it is small and fits in my purse easy. This is the second Kindle that I have purchased and I love it.   "
"25","5","Brooke W.","5 reviews","    I absolutely love my Fire! This is my second one and will probably always buy them. As soon as I activated my new one all my things from the other on where just there, it was super easy. I pretty much use it everyday while watching TV and before bed. It's wonderful and I would recommend one to anyone!   "
"26","4","Stacey S.","85 reviews","    Amazon has come out with yet another great product. I had the first kindle edition that was just the book version. Having amazon prime allows me to access so many different free books, movies & TV shows. I am very satisfied with this product, the only con is that I wish the battery life was longer   "
"27","4","Cassidy M.","49 reviews","    I love this tablet. I got this as a Christmas gift. This product has a smaller screen than most similar products out there. It is easy to use. It has Android system. I have experienced freezing and exiting games when I play them. I would recommend this product to someone with kids or an elder.    "
"28","5","Kathryn G.","19 reviews","    I love my Kindle! It is not the fastest tablet all the time but I love being able to read and play games all on one tablet. It allows me to download many books and games from Amazon. The only issue I have had is storage which I fixed with an SD card and speed which is very rarely a huge issue.   "
"29","5","bethany s.","144 reviews","    My husband and I got our girls Amazon Fire HD 7'' Tablets 18gb. They needed something with a lot of memory but better price than Ipads. We have had no issues whatsoever. They have a ton of games, songs, pics, etc on it and still have a lot of memory. Simple to use. All around great tablet.   "

"33","3","lois m.","183 reviews","    Do not like the layout on this, your ""wallpaper/background"" is amazon adverts? which I for some reason cannot change.I've previously had a nexus which was much nicer to use.Good thing about this is how cheap it is really! probably great if it's just used for reading like a kindle.   "
"34","5","Tierney G.","12 reviews","    In my household we have about 7 or 8 of the Kindle tablets, 4 are currently Fires. They are durable and they offer everything the other tablets have without the hefty price. They are now available in a few sizes and colors, which we like because everyone wants something different.    "

"36","5","Lori K.","18 reviews","    This is a very easy tablet to work with. Small screen was chosen because this travels everywhere with me. No problems connecting and very easy to set up. I purchased when on special through Amazon and will probably upgrade to a larger screen when there is another deal or package !   "

"140","5","Tiffany N.","7 reviews","    I love my Kindle! My ex had a decent Samsung tablet that I enjoyed, but it felt like a giant phone that made no calls. I had a cheapie e-reader I received for Christmas forever and a day ago, and I loved having access to any number of books wherever I was, but I wanted to do more than just read. The obvious choice was the Kindle.It's rare that I let my kids touch my electronics (I'm sorry, I'm just not the mom that lets their kid slobber all over their iPhone... I'm entirely too poor to replace it if they break it) but I do like that I can take advantage of the parental settings super easily with the Kindle in case I do let either my 8 or 9 year old hop on. I don't know that I'll even entertain the thought of getting something other than a Kindle when it's time to replace. It's the perfect blend of tablet and e-reader, in my opinion.    "
"141","5","Kinsey W.","5 reviews","    I wanted a tablet that was affordable and straightforward. I wanted one to watch videos with, check my mail, play games and surf the web. Quite honestly, I was sick of my phone's small screen. My Fire tablet has been wonderful.  I've shopped online, watched videos, read books, listened to music with it. The battery life has been excellent. If you have an Amazon Prime account, you'll find that the tablet works seamlessly with it. The one drawback is the camera. It has a forward and selfie camera, however the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired. Save money and buy the tablet with less GB and purchase a separate memory card-you'll greatly increase your gigs for a fraction of the price.   "

So exercising is another activity that I enjoy in my kindle. Doing school research, browsing, shopping, paying my bills online, playing my favorite game of all times, mage and minions and others like mahjong. I go through battery charges a lot since it is on a great part of my day. The sound and image quality are AMAZING!!! I have never had any issues with my unit. Very fast and reliable tablet.   "
"144","5","Crystal S.","14 reviews","    I purchased 2 of these for my kiddos. At just $50 a piece they are well put together for the price point. They are sturdy enough to withstand the kids.I love the parental control. It makes sure your kids can't purchase anything or see anything inappropriate. You also can put a timer on it and the Amazon Fire will shut off so you can control how long your kids play. The lock code gives only you access to let your kids use the Fire. When the kids are not using them I also like to use them to read, play games and do quick searches. I give the Amazon Fire HD Tablet 5 stars and recommend them for the little ones in your life.   "

"146","5","Colleen W.","47 reviews","    I bought this because Amazon was having a sale where you could get it for around $100 I think. I bought it on a whim thinking I may like reading my books on there and being an artist, I could put my portfolio on there. Having a kindle fire has by far exceeded my expectations. I use this almost every day and I love it. I can watch netflix on it, read my books, browse Pinterest. I didn't want to buy an iPad because I wasn't sure if I would use it hence why I thought the kindle would be good. I'm so glad I did, it has everything I could want and I couldn't be happier.   "

"148","4","Rebecca U.","30 reviews","    I used to have an HDX, but my kids broke it, so this is a replacement for it. Its a bit harder to use, in my opinion. Takes a while for me to find apps/things I stored to cloud. I do not like that it has no restart option-you have to turn it off, then back on again. But, it holds quite a bit of stuff, has fairly fast web browsing, and is adequate for what I do. If you are looking for a better sound/video quality I would go for the more expensive HDX. If you like to read and browse the internet, this one will do ya.    "
"149","5","Megan M.","11 reviews","    We own two of these. One I bought for my 10 year old and one for myself. Great tablet. Love the Amazon underground that has games with unlimited levels and lives. Great picture. I didn't want anything too big and this is perfect. I do wish it was a little louder especially when I'm streaming video but I pair it with my blue tooth speakers and it's fine. And they are currently on sale for under $50 on Amazon so can't complain. Easy to use. Good App Store. Highly recommend    "
"150","4","Allison A.","22 reviews","    Its very simple to use however I hate the ads that pop up on the lock screen. I also don't like that you cannot customize the background screens like on other tablets. It works really well for shopping on Amazon and the kids area is great. If you're looking for a great reader or if you only want to play games its a great tablet. Not all games are available on the Amazon store, and some things wont download at all because there isn't enough room on the tablet.    "
"151","4","Kim P.","26 reviews","    I love my Amazon kindle fire tablets and have purchased 4 of them now! Mine from 2013 still works great, and is my favorite! I also purchase 2 this past summer and they work great too. The newest model ($49) is my least favorite due to a narrower screen and no Swype. However overall these are great tablets with consistent performance! I have Amazon prime so purchase items from their store with free shipping, read their books, and watch videos all on my tablet! It has basically replaced my laptop for me! I've used ipads at work and prefer the use friendly and much more affordable kindle fires!   "
"152","5","Kyla B.","4 reviews","    I got this tablet for my 11 year old son to replace another tablet that took a tumble down a flight of stairs. We've had this tablet for a little while now and have ZERO complaints. The graphics are amazing for videos and games and the processor is speedy. He loves reading on his tablet now and can actually get a full color graphic novel as well. This is an awesome tablet for the price tag and I highly recommend!   "
"153","4","Katherine A.","7 reviews","    This is an upgrade from my original Kindle. I much prefer the backlit screen and larger size. While I still mostly use my Fire as a book, it is a much easier way to check my email or find something online than my smartphone is. I'm old-fashioned I guess but with the cover my Fire feels like I'm actually holding a book. The battery lasts a reasonable amount of time, unlike my phone, and if I'm running low on power it will charge as I read and get ahead of me. There a lot of features I haven't even started to use. I keep liking it better and better.   "
"154","3","Jessie B.","3 reviews","    I bought this tablet specifically for downloading books and reading. For that purpose it performs pretty well. However, as an overall tablet it could be better. The battery life is my main reasoning behind the rating. Even though I only use the tablet for reading, I have to charge the device daily or it will die. On your lock screen, ads are displayed when the tablet is not in use. This does not bother me, but may be a factor to others. Also, it runs pretty slowly and I have noticed some glitching when trying to switch between simple apps.    "
"155","5","Christy W.","14 reviews","    It's worked for everything I needed it to work for. I got it in cobalt green - not black. I really like that it does what I need it to do, quickly. I do wish it had a more clear/crisp volume - it sounds distorted at times, and I wish I had gone with the larger screen option, but I do like it enough not to ever buy a tablet again .. it's just more sturdy feeling, even. Overall, very satisfied. :)   "
"156","5","Rachel G.","6 reviews","    I bought this for my 10-year-old for Christmas and he loves it. The parental contols are really important to me, and Amazon has me covered. I have Amazon Prime and I'm really happy that I can share that with my son. We recently read a book together on our Kindles, and I think that was pretty exciting for him. He is kind of a slob, so I got the blue kid protector, just in case. So far my 3 year old has dropped it 100 times, but it still works just fine! I'm loving the Fire tablets!    "
"157","3","Brooke S.","29 reviews","    I love how lightweight and portable this tablet is. The battery runs very quickly so I constantly have to bring my charging cord with me if I will be using it for a few hours. I bought a Bluetooth keyboard for it and now use this tablet to take notes in class rather than bringing my laptop, and it has worked great for that. I do not like that you cannot change the background to something appealing to you (the background changes and appears as different ads).   "

We've taught them to take care of them, too. My youngest son loves the Little Critter stories that he an choose to have it read to him.   "
"160","5","Rosalie G.","40 reviews","    We recently purchased two of these for two of our children. Favorite part is that you can set up different time limits for different activities and have varying limits depending on the day of the week. So during the week they have short time limit on the device and then the limit is extended for Saturday and completely blocked off for Sunday (that is no electronics allowed day). This is nice that we don't have to keep going g to them to change the limit every day. You can also make the time limits vary between apps and books. We allowed longer time for books.   "

"198","4","Allyssa D.","26 reviews","    I love everything about this tablet and how it's focused around reading. You can't beat the style of it with any other tablet or ereader on the market. I would know: I've owned a Nook and a kobo and this is by far the best. Though nothing can beat a real book.    "
"199","4","Lorece S.","10 reviews","    I love my fire tablet. Because I have amazon prime, I love how seamless it is for me to look at movies, read, and listen to music. The only thing I don't like is the internet browser and the lack of support from outside things that only connect to iPads.    "
"200","3","Hallie B.","12 reviews","    I had high expectations for my Amazon kindle fire HD 7 and truthfully it disappointed me. I'm sure it would probably be perfect for using it as just an e-reader but I got it for browsing the Internet. It is super slow and tends to shut down unexpectedly.    "
